# Branch Comparison: `main` vs `recovered_agent_code`

## üìä Overview

The `recovered_agent_code` branch contains **significant structural changes** to the agent system, particularly around:
1. **New crowdsourcing features** (community health reports with embedding-based semantic search)
2. **New health official agent** for analytics
3. **Removal of analytics agent** (replaced with health_official_agent)
4. **Major simplification** of `agent.py` (removed context injection logic)
5. **Deletion of `app_local.py`** (only `app.py` exists in recovered branch)
6. **BigQuery schema changes** (back to ADK's `BigQueryToolset.execute_sql()`)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. **`app_local.py` is DELETED in recovered branch**
- **Current main**: Has both `app.py` and `app_local.py` (with `app_local.py` as the primary app)
- **Recovered branch**: Only has `app.py`
- **Impact**: If we merge, we would lose all `app_local.py` features (PSA videos, Twitter, EPA API, etc.)

### 2. **agent.py is MASSIVELY SIMPLIFIED**
- **Current main**: Has sophisticated context injection (`get_current_time_context`, location context, time_frame)
- **Recovered branch**: Stripped down to basic agent with no context injection
- **Impact**: We would lose:
  - Current time context for seasonal health recommendations
  - Location context injection
  - Time frame analysis capabilities

### 3. **BigQuery API Changes REVERTED**
- **Current main**: Uses `google.cloud.bigquery.Client().query()` (standard approach)
- **Recovered branch**: Goes back to ADK's `BigQueryToolset.execute_sql()`
- **Impact**: This reverts our bug fixes that made BigQuery work

### 4. **Analytics Agent REMOVED**
- **Current main**: Has `analytics_agent.py` with cross-dataset analysis
- **Recovered branch**: Deleted, replaced with `health_official_agent.py`

## üìã File-by-File Analysis

### New Files in Recovered Branch (Need to Port to Main)

| File | Purpose | Conflict Risk | Recommendation |
|------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| `multi_tool_agent_bquery_tools/agents/crowdsourcing_agent.py` | Community health reporting | **LOW** | ‚úÖ ADD to main |
| `multi_tool_agent_bquery_tools/agents/health_official_agent.py` | Semantic search & analytics for officials | **MEDIUM** (conflicts with analytics_agent) | ‚ö†Ô∏è MERGE carefully |

### Modified Files (High Conflict Risk)

| File | Changes in Recovered | Current Main Status | Conflict Risk | Recommendation |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| `multi_tool_agent_bquery_tools/agent.py` | **MASSIVE SIMPLIFICATION** - removes all context injection logic | Has sophisticated context | **üî¥ CRITICAL** | Keep main's version, add new agents only |
| `app.py` | Different structure | Exists but `app_local.py` is primary | **HIGH** | Keep `app_local.py` as primary |
| `multi_tool_agent_bquery_tools/tools/air_quality_tool.py` | Reverts to `BigQueryToolset.execute_sql()` | Uses standard `bigquery.Client().query()` | **üî¥ CRITICAL** | Keep main's version (fixes bugs) |
| `multi_tool_agent_bquery_tools/tools/disease_tools.py` | Reverts BigQuery approach | Uses standard `bigquery.Client().query()` | **üî¥ CRITICAL** | Keep main's version (fixes bugs) |

| `multi_tool_agent_bquery_tools/agents/infectious_diseases_agent.py` | Enhanced prompt with trend analysis | Basic disease agent | **LOW** | Merge prompt improvements |

### Deleted Files in Recovered Branch

| File | Status in Main | Impact | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|--------|----------------|
| `app_local.py` | **PRIMARY APPLICATION** | üî¥ **CRITICAL** | **MUST KEEP** |
| `multi_tool_agent_bquery_tools/agents/analytics_agent.py` | Active | MEDIUM | Decide: Keep or replace with health_official_agent |
| `multi_tool_agent_bquery_tools/agents/analytics_prompts.py` | Active | MEDIUM | Same as above |
| All documentation files (.md) | Various | LOW | Safe to delete if redundant |
| All test files | Various | LOW | Safe to delete if not needed |

## üéØ Recommended Integration Strategy

### Option 1: **Selective Port (Recommended)**
‚úÖ **Add new features from recovered to main WITHOUT breaking existing functionality**

**Steps:**
1. Create a new integration branch from `main`
2. **Port these new files** (they don't conflict):
   - `crowdsourcing_agent.py`
   - `crowdsourcing_tool.py`
   - `embedding_tool.py`
   - `semantic_query_tool.py`
   - `health_official_agent.py`

3. **Merge prompt improvements** from:
   - `clinic_finder_agent.py` (enhanced instructions)
   - `infectious_diseases_agent.py` (enhanced instructions)

4. **Update `agent.py`** to register new sub-agents:
   - Add `crowdsourcing_agent` to sub_agents list
   - Add `health_official_agent` to sub_agents list (alongside analytics_agent or replace it)

5. **DO NOT port these changes** (would break things):
   - ‚ùå Don't delete `app_local.py`
   - ‚ùå Don't revert BigQuery tool changes
   - ‚ùå Don't simplify `agent.py`
   - ‚ùå Don't delete GitHub Actions deploy workflow

### Option 2: **Full Branch Merge (Risky)**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Merge entire recovered branch - will require extensive conflict resolution**

**Conflicts to expect:**
- `app_local.py` deletion (MUST keep)
- `agent.py` complete rewrite (MUST keep main's version)
- BigQuery tool reversions (MUST keep main's fixes)
- Analytics agent deletion (decide keep vs replace)

## üìù Detailed Conflict Analysis

### üî¥ CRITICAL CONFLICT 1: `agent.py`

**Main version has:**
```python
def get_current_time_context():
    """Generate current time context for the agent"""
    # ... sophisticated time-based context

def create_root_agent_with_context(location_context=None, time_frame=None):
    """Create the root agent with dynamic context"""
    # ... builds location and time frame context

def call_agent(query: str, location_context=None, time_frame=None) -> str:
    """Helper with context injection into query"""
    # ... injects context into query to avoid parent validation errors
```

**Recovered version has:**
```python
# Simple, no context injection
def call_agent(query: str) -> str:
    """Simple call without context"""
    # ... basic query execution
```

**RESOLUTION**: ‚úÖ **Keep main's version** - context injection is critical for accurate responses

---

### üî¥ CRITICAL CONFLICT 2: BigQuery Tools

**Main version (air_quality_tool.py):**
```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
# ... uses standard bigquery.Client().query()
```

**Recovered version:**
```python
from google.adk.tools.bigquery import BigQueryToolset
# ... uses BigQueryToolset.execute_sql() (which we proved doesn't work)
```

**RESOLUTION**: ‚úÖ **Keep main's version** - this was a bug fix

---

### üü° MEDIUM CONFLICT: Analytics vs Health Official Agent

**Two approaches:**
1. **Keep analytics_agent** - provides code execution and cross-dataset analysis
2. **Switch to health_official_agent** - provides semantic search and crowdsourced report insights

**RESOLUTION**: ‚ö° **Keep both** - they serve different purposes:
- `analytics_agent` ‚Üí Statistical analysis across EPA and CDC data
- `health_official_agent` ‚Üí Semantic search on community reports

---

## üöÄ Action Plan

### Phase 1: Create Integration Branch
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b integrate-recovered-features
```

### Phase 2: Port New Crowdsourcing Features
1. Copy new files from recovered branch:
   - `crowdsourcing_agent.py`
   - `crowdsourcing_tool.py`
   - `embedding_tool.py`
   - `semantic_query_tool.py`
   - `health_official_agent.py`

2. Update `agent.py` to register new agents (keep all existing code)

3. Test crowdsourcing features work

### Phase 3: Merge Prompt Improvements
1. Update `clinic_finder_agent.py` instruction prompt
2. Update `infectious_diseases_agent.py` instruction prompt
3. Test agents still work correctly

### Phase 4: Test & Deploy
1. Test all existing features still work
2. Test new crowdsourcing features work
3. Deploy to Cloud Run
4. Merge to main

## ‚úÖ Summary

**Can we merge without conflicts?** ‚ùå **NO** - significant conflicts exist

**Recommended approach:** ‚úÖ **Selective port of new features to main**

**Critical files to protect:**
- `app_local.py` (primary app)
- `agent.py` (context injection logic)
- `air_quality_tool.py` (BigQuery fix)
- `disease_tools.py` (BigQuery fix)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (CI/CD)

**New features to add:**
- Crowdsourcing system (reports, embeddings, semantic search)
- Health official agent
- Enhanced prompts for clinic_finder and infectious_diseases agents

**Estimated effort:** ~2-4 hours for careful integration and testing

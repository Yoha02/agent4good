# 🎥 Video Polling Status Fix

**Date**: October 27, 2025 - 2:06 AM  
**Issue**: Video generation polling shows "Unknown status: generating_video"  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🐛 **Problem**

The video polling logic in the officials dashboard chat widget was showing warnings:
```
[VIDEO WIDGET] Unknown status: generating_video
```

This happened because the frontend polling function didn't recognize all the statuses that the backend video manager returns.

### What Was Happening:
1. User requests video generation
2. Backend starts video generation with status `'initializing'`
3. Backend updates to `'generating_action_line'`, `'creating_prompt'`, then `'generating_video'`
4. Frontend polling only recognized `'processing'` and `'pending'`
5. **Result**: Warnings logged, but polling continued (so video would eventually complete)

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

### Backend Statuses (from `async_video_manager.py`):
```python
'initializing'           # Initial task creation
'generating_action_line' # Creating the PSA message
'creating_prompt'        # Building the video prompt
'generating_video'       # Calling Veo 3.1 API
'complete'              # Video ready with URL
'error'                 # Generation failed
```

### Frontend Polling (BEFORE fix):
```javascript
if (data.status === 'complete' && data.video_url) {
    // Video ready
} else if (data.status === 'error' || data.status === 'failed') {
    // Failed
} else if (data.status === 'processing' || data.status === 'pending') {
    // Continue polling ✅
} else {
    // ❌ Unknown status warning - but still continues polling
}
```

**Problem**: `'generating_video'`, `'initializing'`, `'generating_action_line'`, and `'creating_prompt'` fell into the "unknown status" catch-all.

---

## ✅ **Solution**

Updated the polling logic to explicitly recognize ALL backend statuses.

### Frontend Polling (AFTER fix):
```javascript
if (data.status === 'complete' && data.video_url) {
    // Video ready - stop polling
    clearInterval(pollInterval);
    addChatMessage(videoMessage, 'bot');
} else if (data.status === 'error' || data.status === 'failed') {
    // Failed - stop polling
    clearInterval(pollInterval);
    addChatMessage('Sorry, video generation failed.', 'bot');
} else if (data.status === 'initializing' || 
           data.status === 'generating_action_line' || 
           data.status === 'creating_prompt' || 
           data.status === 'generating_video' ||
           data.status === 'processing' || 
           data.status === 'pending') {
    // ✅ All processing states recognized - continue polling
    console.log(`[VIDEO WIDGET] Video still ${data.status} (progress: ${data.progress}%)`);
} else {
    // Truly unknown status (should never happen)
    console.warn(`[VIDEO WIDGET] Unknown status: ${data.status}`);
}
```

## 📊 **Status Flow**

Normal video generation flow:

```
User Request
    ↓
initializing (0%)
    ↓
generating_action_line (10%)
    ↓
creating_prompt (20%)
    ↓
generating_video (30-95%)
    ↓
complete (100%) ✅
```

Error flow:
```
Any Step
    ↓
error ❌
```

## 🧪 **Testing**

### To Test Video Generation:

1. **Login as Health Official**
2. **Open chat widget** (bottom right)
3. **Type**: "Generate PSA video for current location"
4. **Expected Console Logs** (no warnings):
   ```
   [VIDEO WIDGET] Starting to poll for task 7827b727
   [VIDEO WIDGET] Poll attempt 1/120
   [VIDEO WIDGET] Video still initializing (progress: 0%)
   [VIDEO WIDGET] Poll attempt 2/120
   [VIDEO WIDGET] Video still generating_action_line (progress: 10%)
   [VIDEO WIDGET] Poll attempt 3/120
   [VIDEO WIDGET] Video still creating_prompt (progress: 20%)
   [VIDEO WIDGET] Poll attempt 4/120
   [VIDEO WIDGET] Video still generating_video (progress: 30%)
   ...
   [VIDEO WIDGET] Poll attempt 60/120
   [VIDEO WIDGET] Video still generating_video (progress: 95%)
   [VIDEO WIDGET] Poll attempt 61/120
   [VIDEO WIDGET] Video ready: https://...
   ```

5. **Video appears** in chat with Twitter posting prompt
6. **No "Unknown status" warnings** ✅

## 📝 **Files Modified**

### `static/js/officials-dashboard.js`
- **Line 2004-2009**: Added explicit checks for all backend statuses
- **Improved logging**: Now shows actual status name in progress logs

---

## 🔄 **Comparison with Main Chat Page**

The main chat page (`static/js/app.js`) has simpler logic:
```javascript
if (status.status === 'complete') {
    // Done
} else if (status.status === 'error') {
    // Failed  
}
// Otherwise just continue polling (no warnings)
```

This works fine because it doesn't warn about unknown statuses. The officials dashboard was more verbose with warnings, which is why the issue was visible there.

---

## ✅ **What This Fixes**

1. ✅ **No more "Unknown status" console warnings**
2. ✅ **Better progress tracking** - logs show actual status
3. ✅ **Clearer debugging** - exact stage is visible
4. ✅ **Code clarity** - explicit list of valid statuses
5. ✅ **Future-proof** - all backend statuses accounted for

## 🚀 **Status**

- [x] Issue identified
- [x] Fix implemented
- [x] No linter errors
- [ ] **Ready for testing** - Please test video generation in browser
- [ ] **DO NOT PUSH YET** - Awaiting user confirmation

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Test video generation** in browser UI
2. If successful → commit the fix
3. If issues remain → investigate further

---

## 💡 **Technical Note**

The polling was actually working before (videos would complete), but the warnings made it seem broken. This fix improves the user experience by:
- Removing confusing warnings
- Providing clearer progress feedback
- Making the code more maintainable

The real issue preventing videos from displaying was the status value mismatch (`'completed'` vs `'complete'`), which was already fixed in the previous commit.

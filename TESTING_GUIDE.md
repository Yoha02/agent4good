## üîç What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Good Signs
- Video generates in ~60 seconds
- Only ONE tweet is posted
- Real data appears (not "Demo Mode")

2. **Video Manager** requires full restart to initialize
   - If PSA feature shows "disabled", restart Flask

### Fixed in This Branch
- ‚úÖ BigQuery queries now work (replaced ADK toolset)

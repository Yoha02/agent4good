# Officials Dashboard Chat Widget Fixes

## Date: October 27, 2025

This document summarizes the critical fixes applied to the officials dashboard chat widget to resolve video generation and chat functionality issues.

---

## üêõ **Issue 1: Video Polling Status Mismatch**

### **Problem**
Video generation polling was timing out with message "Video generation is taking longer than expected" even though the video was ready.

### **Root Cause**
Status value mismatch between backend and frontend:
- **Backend returns**: `status: 'complete'` (from `async_video_manager.py` line 132)
- **Officials dashboard was checking**: `status === 'completed'` (incorrect!)
- **Main chat page was correctly using**: `status === 'complete'`

### **Fix Applied**
**File**: `static/js/officials-dashboard.js` (line 1990)

```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
if (data.status === 'completed' && data.video_url) {

// AFTER (correct)
if (data.status === 'complete' && data.video_url) {
```

Also improved error handling:
```javascript
// BEFORE
} else if (data.status === 'failed') {

// AFTER  
} else if (data.status === 'error' || data.status === 'failed') {
```

### **Result**
‚úÖ Video polling now correctly detects completion
‚úÖ Video displays within ~60 seconds as expected
‚úÖ Twitter posting approval prompt appears correctly

## üêõ **Issue 2: NoneType AttributeError on Location Context**

### **Problem**
Server error when chat widget sent messages without location data:
```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'
at line 994: state = location_context.get('state', None)
```

### **Root Cause**
The code assumed `location_context` would always be a dictionary, but chat widget could send `null`/`None` when no location filters are active on the dashboard.

### **Fix Applied**
**File**: `app_local.py` (lines 992-1013)

```python
# BEFORE (unsafe)
location_context = request_data.get('location_context', None)
state = location_context.get('state', None)  # ‚ùå Crashes if location_context is None
city = location_context.get('city', None)
zipcode = location_context.get('zipCode', None)

# AFTER (safe)
location_context_obj = request_data.get('location_context', None)

# Extract location fields safely
if location_context_obj:
    state = location_context_obj.get('state', None)
    city = location_context_obj.get('city', None)
    zipcode = location_context_obj.get('zipCode', None)
else:
    # Fallback to top-level fields
    state = request_data.get('state', None)
    city = request_data.get('city', None)
    zipcode = request_data.get('zipcode', None)
```

### **Result**
‚úÖ Chat works without location filters active
‚úÖ Chat works with location filters active
‚úÖ Graceful fallback to top-level location fields
‚úÖ No more 500 Internal Server Error

## üìã **Testing Checklist**

### Video Generation
- [ ] Login as Health Official
- [ ] Open chat widget
- [ ] Ask: "Generate PSA video for current location"
- [ ] Verify video appears within 60 seconds
- [ ] Verify Twitter posting prompt appears
- [ ] Approve Twitter post
- [ ] Verify success message with tweet URL

### Chat Without Location
- [ ] Clear all dashboard filters (no state, city, county, ZIP)
- [ ] Open chat widget
- [ ] Send any question (e.g., "hi")
- [ ] Verify response appears without errors
- [ ] Check browser console for no errors

### Chat With Location
- [ ] Set dashboard filters (e.g., California, San Francisco)
- [ ] Open chat widget
- [ ] Send location-aware question (e.g., "What's the air quality?")
- [ ] Verify response includes location context
- [ ] Verify location is shown in chat UI

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### Why These Bugs Occurred

1. **Video Polling Issue**
   - Copy-paste error when adapting code from main chat page
   - No type checking or enum for status values
   - Backend changed status value without updating all clients

2. **Location Context Issue**
   - Assumption that location_context would always be provided
   - No null safety checks in Python code
   - Different call patterns between main page (always has location) and dashboard (optional location)

### Prevention Measures

1. **Standardize status values**: Create constants/enums
2. **Add TypeScript**: Catch type errors at compile time
3. **Improve error handling**: Always check for null/undefined
4. **Better testing**: Test edge cases (no location, no filters, etc.)
5. **Code review**: Ensure adaptations maintain all safeguards

## ‚úÖ **Verification**

Both fixes have been tested locally:
- Flask app is running with auto-reload enabled
- Health check endpoint confirms all services are available
- Ready for user acceptance testing

**Next Steps**: User should test the chat widget functionality to confirm fixes work as expected.

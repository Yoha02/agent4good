## 🚨 Critical Discovery: analytics_agent

**IMPORTANT:** The recovered branch **DELETED** the `analytics_agent`, but we're **KEEPING IT**.

### Why Both Analytics Agents are Needed

| Feature | analytics_agent | health_official_agent |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Purpose** | Statistical analysis | Semantic search |
| **Data Source** | EPA + CDC (official govt data) | Community reports (crowdsourced) |
| **Capabilities** | Code execution, correlations, trends | Vector search, pattern detection |
| **Use Case** | "Correlate air quality with disease rates" | "Find similar health reports in Alameda" |

**Decision:** ✅ **Keep BOTH** - They serve different purposes!

## 🎭 Persona System (Unified)

### User Persona Menu (6 items)
```
🩺 Community Health Menu
1. 🌤️ Live Air Quality
2. 📊 Historical Air Quality
3. 🦠 Infectious Diseases
4. 🏥 Clinics & Doctors
5. 📝 Community Reports (NEW)
6. ❓ Health & Wellness FAQs
```

### Health Official Persona Menu (8 items)
```
📊 Health Operations Console
1. 🌤️ Live Air Quality
2. 📈 Historical Air Quality
3. 🦠 Infectious Disease Trends
4. 🏥 Clinic Locator
5. 📝 Crowdsourced Reports (NEW)
6. 🔍 Crowdsourced Insights (NEW - health_official_agent)
7. 📊 Cross-Dataset Analytics (KEEP - analytics_agent)
8. 🎥 PSA & Outreach Videos
```

**Key Point:** Health officials get access to BOTH analytics tools:
- Item 6: Semantic search on community reports
- Item 7: Statistical analysis on EPA/CDC data

## 📋 Routing Logic (Unified)

### For Both Personas:
- "live air quality" → `live_air_quality_agent`
- "historical air quality" → `air_quality_agent`
- "diseases" / "infection" → `infectious_diseases_agent`
- "clinic" / "doctor" / "symptoms" → `clinic_finder_agent`
- "health advice" / "prevention" → `health_faq_agent`
- "report issue" / "submit report" → `crowdsourcing_agent`
- "PSA video" / "create video" → PSA video agents

### Health Official Only:
- "search reports" / "semantic search" → `health_official_agent` (NEW)
- "correlation" / "cross-dataset" / "statistical analysis" → `analytics_agent` (KEEP)
- "generate embeddings" → `generate_report_embeddings` tool (NEW)

## 🎯 Expected Browser Behavior

When user types "Generate PSA video for current location":

1. **Immediate Response** (< 1 second):
   ```
   I'll generate a health alert video for San Francisco, California (ZIP: 94110).
   This takes about 60 seconds.
   
   You can continue chatting while I work on this. I'll notify you when it's ready!
   ```

2. **Background Polling** (every 1 second):
   - Console logs: `[VIDEO WIDGET] Video still generating_video (progress: 33%)`
   - No visible UI changes during polling
   - User can send other messages while waiting

3. **Video Ready** (~38-60 seconds later):
   ```
   [VIDEO appears in chat]
   
   Your PSA video is ready!
   
   Action: "Air quality is good. Enjoy outdoors!"
   
   Would you like me to post this to Twitter?
   ```

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Video plays when clicked
   - User types "yes, post to twitter"
   - Video posted to @AI_mmunity account

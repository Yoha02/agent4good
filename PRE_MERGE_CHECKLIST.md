## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
Current `.env` variables work fine. Optional new variable:

```bash
LOGIN_ROLE=user  # or "health_official" (defaults to "user")
```

### Cloud Run Deployment
No changes needed to existing Cloud Run configuration. The app will work with current settings.

### Optional: BigQuery Tables
If you want crowdsourcing features in production, create these tables:
- `CrowdsourceData.CrowdSourceData`
- `CrowdsourceData.ReportEmbeddings`

See `BUGFIX_CROWDSOURCING_TABLE.md` for schemas.

## 🎯 Merge Strategy

### Recommended: Fast-Forward Merge

```bash
# 1. Ensure we're on integrate-crowdsourcing-features
git status

# 2. Make sure everything is committed
git add .
git commit -m "Complete crowdsourcing integration: 5 new files, 3 enhanced agents, dual persona system"

# 3. Push to remote
git push origin integrate-crowdsourcing-features

# 4. Switch to main
git checkout main

# 5. Pull latest main
git pull origin main

# 6. Merge integration branch
git merge integrate-crowdsourcing-features

# 7. Push to main
git push origin main
```

### Alternative: Pull Request (if using GitHub workflow)
1. Push integrate-crowdsourcing-features to remote
2. Create PR on GitHub
3. Review changes
4. Merge via GitHub UI

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Risk Level: 🟢 **VERY LOW**

**Why Low Risk:**
- All changes are in `multi_tool_agent_bquery_tools/` only
- No changes to `app_local.py`, `app.js`, or frontend
- All changes are additive (no deletions)
- Existing features fully preserved
- Backward compatible
- Graceful degradation (crowdsourcing fails gracefully without BQ tables)

### Rollback Plan (if needed)
```bash
# If issues arise after merge
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

---

## ✅ FINAL APPROVAL

**Ready to Merge:** ✅ **YES**

**Confidence Level:** 🟢 **HIGH**

**Recommendation:** Proceed with merge to main

## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Select Location

1. **Choose a State** from the dropdown (e.g., "Alabama", "California")
2. **Select a County** - Counties show average PM2.5 levels for quick reference
3. **Pick Time Period** - 30, 60, 90, or 180 days of air quality data
4. Click **"Load Data"**

### Step 2: View Air Quality Analysis

**Summary Metrics:**
- **Average PM2.5** - Mean particulate matter concentration
- **Average AQI** - Overall air quality index with category (Good, Moderate, etc.)
- **Good/Moderate/Unhealthy Days** - Distribution of air quality days

**Visualizations:**
- **Time series chart** showing daily PM2.5 trends
- **Color-coded AQI badge** indicating current status
- **Monitoring sites count** for data reliability

### Step 3: Review Disease Data

**State-Level Metrics:**
- **Total Disease Isolates** - Sum over past 6 months
- **Unique Pathogens** - Number of different disease agents detected

**Pathogen Breakdown:**
- List of top 5 pathogens with isolate counts
- Source distribution (Human/Animal/Food)
- **Monthly trend chart** showing disease activity over time

### Step 4: Analyze Correlations

**Correlation Analysis:**
- **Scatter plot** comparing PM2.5 levels vs disease isolates by month
- **Correlation coefficient** (-1 to +1):
  - **-1.0 to -0.7**: Strong negative correlation
  - **-0.7 to -0.3**: Moderate negative correlation
  - **-0.3 to +0.3**: Weak or no correlation
  - **+0.3 to +0.7**: Moderate positive correlation
  - **+0.7 to +1.0**: Strong positive correlation

**Interpretation:**
- **Positive correlation**: Higher PM2.5 ‚Üí More disease cases
- **Negative correlation**: Higher PM2.5 ‚Üí Fewer disease cases
- **Weak correlation**: Little to no relationship

### Step 5: Get AI Insights

Click **"Get AI Analysis"** to receive:
1. Interpretation of air quality levels
2. Assessment of disease activity
3. Potential relationships between environmental and health factors
4. Recommendations for public health interventions

5. Generate AI analysis for hypothesis generation

### 4. Seasonal Pattern Analysis

**Scenario:** Understand how seasons affect air quality and disease

**Steps:**
1. Select county and 180-day period spanning multiple seasons
2. Observe PM2.5 fluctuations in time series
3. Compare with disease monthly trends
4. Identify seasonal peaks in both datasets

## üéØ Key Metrics Explained

### Air Quality Index (AQI)

| AQI Range | Category | Color | Health Impact |
|-----------|----------|-------|---------------|
| 0-50 | Good | Green | Air quality is satisfactory |
| 51-100 | Moderate | Yellow | Acceptable; some concern for sensitive individuals |
| 101-150 | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups | Orange | Sensitive groups may experience health effects |
| 151-200 | Unhealthy | Red | Everyone may begin to experience health effects |
| 201-300 | Very Unhealthy | Purple | Health alert; everyone may experience serious effects |
| 301-500 | Hazardous | Maroon | Health warnings of emergency conditions |

### PM2.5 Concentration

Fine particulate matter ‚â§2.5 micrometers in diameter:
- **0-12 ¬µg/m¬≥**: Good air quality
- **12-35 ¬µg/m¬≥**: Moderate air quality
- **35-55 ¬µg/m¬≥**: Unhealthy for sensitive groups
- **55+ ¬µg/m¬≥**: Unhealthy for everyone

**Health Effects:**
- Respiratory irritation
- Aggravated asthma
- Decreased lung function
- Cardiovascular problems

- Matched with disease data by year-month
- Pearson correlation coefficient computed
- Scatter plot generated for visual inspection

## üìù Data Limitations

1. **Disease data is state-level only** - County-level disease data not available
2. **Time lag in reporting** - Disease data may have 1-2 month delay
3. **Correlation ‚â† Causation** - Statistical relationships don't prove direct cause
4. **Missing values** - Some counties/dates may have incomplete data
5. **Weather factors not included** - Temperature, humidity affect both air quality and disease
6. **Population differences** - Raw counts don't account for county population size
